# ldap-go

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

`ldap-go` is a Go implementation of an LDAPv3 directory server targeting
behavioral and LDIF data compatibility with OpenLDAP 2.6.x. It includes a
persistent directory server, OpenLDAP-style client and offline tools, an LDAP
load balancer, and a bilingual Web administration console.

The project is under active development and is not a complete OpenLDAP drop-in
replacement. Treat the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md) as the
authoritative support boundary.

Common school/company directory workflows have passed the
[practical acceptance checks](docs/common-production-scope.md#practical-acceptance-on-2026-09-20):
10,000-user import/query/paging/persistence, crash recovery, single-writer
replication recovery, backup/restore, Web administration, and a same-SDK
OpenLDAP differential. This is a bounded functional acceptance, not complete
OpenLDAP parity or a capacity guarantee for every deployment.

## Explicit non-goals

- **OpenLDAP MDB/LMDB:** reimplementing its storage engine, native database files,
  and index format is outside the project scope. ldap-go uses bbolt; migrate
  directory data through `slapcat` LDIF rather than copying MDB files.
- **Third-party modules:** further reimplementation of third-party modules and
  compatibility with their native module-loading ABIs are outside the project
  scope. Existing pure-Go implementations remain available within the
  [documented module coverage](docs/openldap-module-coverage.md).

These are deliberate scope exclusions, not pending features or gaps to count
against completion of the in-scope OpenLDAP functionality.

## Highlights

- LDAPv3 Bind, Search, Compare, Add, Modify, Delete, ModifyDN, StartTLS,
  Password Modify, common controls, aliases, referrals, and transactions.
- bbolt persistence with atomic LDIF import/export, backup, restore, rebuild,
  integrity checking, online backup, and retention tooling.
- OpenLDAP `cn=config`, schema, ACL, overlay, replication, Monitor, proxy, and
  offline-tool compatibility for the explicitly tested subset.
- Simple Bind, SASL PLAIN/CRAM-MD5/DIGEST-MD5/SCRAM/GSSAPI/EXTERNAL, TLS,
  LDAPS, LDAPI, and GB/T 38636 TLCP transports.
- OpenLDAP password schemes plus SM3, salted SM3, PBKDF2-SM3, and supported
  contributed password modules.
- ACL-preserving Web administration with English and Simplified Chinese UI.
- Differential tests against a pinned OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference build.

Detailed implementation claims and boundaries are recorded in the
[implementation status](docs/implementation-status.md), not duplicated here.

## Performance snapshot

Latest common-operation comparison: September 24, 2026, fourth run, 100,000 users,
baseline `aaf8350` versus final `current-sized`, Apple M1 Pro, Go without cgo,
OpenLDAP 2.6.13. These are batch-time medians from three repetitions with endpoints
rotated per request. Only SDK calls are timed; response validation is outside
timing. Both servers have uid/member/objectClass equality indexes. Relative
performance is `OpenLDAP / ldap-go * 100%`.
Usage frequency is a qualitative estimate for authentication/directory workloads,
not measured traffic.

| Common operation | Typical use | Calls | ldap-go, default access | OpenLDAP, default access | Relative, default | Relative, explicit ACL |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| User Bind, SSHA | Very high | 1,000 | 86.14 ms | 68.59 ms | 79.6% | 77.6% |
| Non-root Base, hot | High | 1,000 | 112.90 ms | 84.84 ms | 75.1% | 71.8% |
| Non-root indexed equality, hot | Very high | 1,000 | 114.47 ms | 87.58 ms | 76.5% | 70.2% |
| Direct group discovery | High | 100 | 17.02 ms | 10.66 ms | 62.7% | 52.5% |
| Group Base, 1,000 members | Medium | 100 | 84.49 ms | 80.66 ms | 95.5% | 92.8% |
| Nested membership, client BFS | Medium-high | 100 traversals | 53.03 ms | 36.51 ms | 68.8% | 65.1% |

The [common-operation report](docs/common-ldap-performance.md) includes distributed
user reads, exact ACL definitions, all samples and validation. The
[SDK runner](internal/cmd/ldapcommonbench/README.md) is reusable on disposable
endpoints. Against `aaf8350`, SSHA Bind takes **7.6%-9.9% less time**, ordinary user
queries 3.3%-9.5% less, group discovery 6.3%-9.2% less, and nested membership
6.3%-7.8% less. The four-operation parity goal is **not complete**. The first R4
attempt is retained as diagnostic evidence: its shortcut rejected the SDK's
positive search size limits. The final implementation supports those limits
without changing the benchmark workload. Password strength, both authentication
snapshot checks and live ACL decisions are preserved. The report retains the
pre-existing operational-attribute compatibility gap and links the
[archived third run](docs/common-ldap-performance-20260924-r3.md).

Timing boundaries and group fixtures differ from the
[earlier full-operation comparison](docs/performance-optimization-20260923-round13.md),
which retains write, paging, concurrency and memory measurements.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or newer.
- Production binaries build with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; a C compiler is not required.
- OpenLDAP client tools are optional for manual interoperability checks.
- Node.js and Chromium are needed only for Web administration browser tests.
- Building the pinned OpenLDAP differential environment requires the native
  dependencies documented in [testing](docs/testing.md).

## Quick start

Build the binary, import the example directory, and start an LDAP listener:

```sh
mkdir -p ./bin ./data
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./bin/ldap-go ./cmd/ldap-go

./bin/ldap-go import \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./examples/base.ldif \
  -replace

LDAP_GO_ROOT_PASSWORD='change-me' \
  ./bin/ldap-go serve \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -root-dn cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
```

Query it with an OpenLDAP client in another terminal:

```sh
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com -W \
  -b dc=example,dc=com '(objectClass=*)'
```

Start the Web administration console against the same LDAP listener:

```sh
./bin/ldap-go web-admin \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 \
  -ldap-url ldap://127.0.0.1:1389
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and sign in with an LDAP Bind DN. See
[operations](docs/operations.md) for LDAPI, OpenLDAP connections, TLS/TLCP,
backups, auditing, health checks, and production deployment.

## OpenLDAP migration

OpenLDAP backend files are implementation-specific and cannot be copied into
ldap-go. Export from a stopped or application-read-only source so separately
captured databases form a consistent migration set, then use `slapcat` LDIF as
the migration contract:

```sh
slapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif
slapcat -n 1 -l data-1.ldif

./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./config.ldif -replace
./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./data-1.ldif -database 1 -replace
```

The supported multi-database flow, offline aliases, validation behavior, and
password hash policy are documented in
[migration and passwords](docs/migration-and-passwords.md).

For a legacy `slapd.conf`, convert and validate the configuration in pure Go
before importing directory data:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./cmd/slapdconf-convert \
  -f /path/to/slapd.conf -out ./config.ldif
```

See [slapd.conf conversion](docs/slapdconf-conversion.md) for supported
directives, strict failure behavior, and direct database output.

## Development

Run the normal local checks:

```sh
go test ./...
make compat
```

Run the complete pinned OpenLDAP, race, fuzz, and Web administration gate:

```sh
make full
```

See [testing](docs/testing.md) before running `make full`; it builds a pinned
OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference and requires native build dependencies. Release and
upgrade checks are documented in [release](docs/release.md).
