# ldap-go

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

`ldap-go` is a Go implementation of an LDAPv3 directory server targeting
behavioral and LDIF data compatibility with OpenLDAP 2.6.x. It includes a
persistent directory server, OpenLDAP-style client and offline tools, an LDAP
load balancer, and a bilingual Web administration console.

The project is under active development and is not a complete OpenLDAP drop-in
replacement. Treat the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md) as the
authoritative support boundary.

Common school/company directory workflows have passed the
[practical acceptance checks](docs/common-production-scope.md#practical-acceptance-on-2026-09-20):
10,000-user import/query/paging/persistence, crash recovery, single-writer
replication recovery, backup/restore, Web administration, and a same-SDK
OpenLDAP differential. This is a bounded functional acceptance, not complete
OpenLDAP parity or a capacity guarantee for every deployment.

## Explicit non-goals

- **OpenLDAP MDB/LMDB:** reimplementing its storage engine, native database files,
  and index format is outside the project scope. ldap-go uses bbolt; migrate
  directory data through `slapcat` LDIF rather than copying MDB files.
- **Third-party modules:** further reimplementation of third-party modules and
  compatibility with their native module-loading ABIs are outside the project
  scope. Existing pure-Go implementations remain available within the
  [documented module coverage](docs/openldap-module-coverage.md).

These are deliberate scope exclusions, not pending features or gaps to count
against completion of the in-scope OpenLDAP functionality.

## Highlights

- LDAPv3 Bind, Search, Compare, Add, Modify, Delete, ModifyDN, StartTLS,
  Password Modify, common controls, aliases, referrals, and transactions.
- bbolt persistence with atomic LDIF import/export, backup, restore, rebuild,
  integrity checking, online backup, and retention tooling.
- OpenLDAP `cn=config`, schema, ACL, overlay, replication, Monitor, proxy, and
  offline-tool compatibility for the explicitly tested subset.
- Simple Bind, SASL PLAIN/CRAM-MD5/DIGEST-MD5/SCRAM/GSSAPI/EXTERNAL, TLS,
  LDAPS, LDAPI, and GB/T 38636 TLCP transports.
- OpenLDAP password schemes plus SM3, salted SM3, PBKDF2-SM3, and supported
  contributed password modules.
- ACL-preserving Web administration with English and Simplified Chinese UI.
- Differential tests against a pinned OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference build.

Detailed implementation claims and boundaries are recorded in the
[implementation status](docs/implementation-status.md), not duplicated here.

## Performance snapshot

Latest SDK comparison: September 23, 2026, 100,000 users, Apple M1 Pro,
Go built without cgo, OpenLDAP 2.6.13. Values are batch-time medians; operation
counts are shown. Bind and short queries use nine interleaved batches on one
warmed process per implementation. Scans and writes use three fresh processes.
Writes follow setup and cache warmup.
Relative performance is `OpenLDAP / ldap-go * 100%`; above 100% favors ldap-go.

| Metric | Operations | ldap-go | OpenLDAP | Relative performance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| User Bind, SSHA | 3,000 | 380.35 ms | 195.69 ms | 51.5% |
| Root Bind | 3,000 | 269.17 ms | 194.37 ms | 72.2% |
| Base search | 3,000 | 308.35 ms | 245.55 ms | 79.6% |
| Indexed equality | 3,000 | 321.94 ms | 268.46 ms | 83.4% |
| Compare, matching | 3,000 | 325.59 ms | 209.41 ms | 64.3% |
| Prefix substring | 20 | 906.59 ms | 618.63 ms | 68.2% |
| Negative substring | 20 | 900.94 ms | 621.25 ms | 69.0% |
| Add | 20 | 15.46 ms | 110.41 ms | 714.0% |
| Modify, unindexed description | 20 | 8.23 ms | 116.95 ms | 1,420.8% |
| ModifyDN | 20 | 28.39 ms | 111.31 ms | 392.0% |
| Delete | 20 | 18.60 ms | 117.94 ms | 634.2% |

Complete ordinary-attribute exports matched. The [latest report](docs/performance-optimization-20260923-round12.md)
records about 18% lower substring latency against `9581b3d`. Short operations
remain mixed, including slower results; the initial replay, batch recheck and
per-request recheck are all retained. Read/auth RSS in the initial replay was
414.2 / 95.6 MiB. Small serial write results do not generalize to every production
workload. Startup, cold initialization, Bind, substrings and memory remain gaps.
The [write-index report](docs/performance-optimization-20260923-round8.md)
documents initialization costs; [historical paging results](docs/openldap-100k-evidence.md)
use a different workload.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or newer.
- Production binaries build with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; a C compiler is not required.
- OpenLDAP client tools are optional for manual interoperability checks.
- Node.js and Chromium are needed only for Web administration browser tests.
- Building the pinned OpenLDAP differential environment requires the native
  dependencies documented in [testing](docs/testing.md).

## Quick start

Build the binary, import the example directory, and start an LDAP listener:

```sh
mkdir -p ./bin ./data
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./bin/ldap-go ./cmd/ldap-go

./bin/ldap-go import \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./examples/base.ldif \
  -replace

LDAP_GO_ROOT_PASSWORD='change-me' \
  ./bin/ldap-go serve \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -root-dn cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
```

Query it with an OpenLDAP client in another terminal:

```sh
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com -W \
  -b dc=example,dc=com '(objectClass=*)'
```

Start the Web administration console against the same LDAP listener:

```sh
./bin/ldap-go web-admin \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 \
  -ldap-url ldap://127.0.0.1:1389
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and sign in with an LDAP Bind DN. See
[operations](docs/operations.md) for LDAPI, OpenLDAP connections, TLS/TLCP,
backups, auditing, health checks, and production deployment.

## OpenLDAP migration

OpenLDAP backend files are implementation-specific and cannot be copied into
ldap-go. Export from a stopped or application-read-only source so separately
captured databases form a consistent migration set, then use `slapcat` LDIF as
the migration contract:

```sh
slapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif
slapcat -n 1 -l data-1.ldif

./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./config.ldif -replace
./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./data-1.ldif -database 1 -replace
```

The supported multi-database flow, offline aliases, validation behavior, and
password hash policy are documented in
[migration and passwords](docs/migration-and-passwords.md).

For a legacy `slapd.conf`, convert and validate the configuration in pure Go
before importing directory data:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./cmd/slapdconf-convert \
  -f /path/to/slapd.conf -out ./config.ldif
```

See [slapd.conf conversion](docs/slapdconf-conversion.md) for supported
directives, strict failure behavior, and direct database output.

## Development

Run the normal local checks:

```sh
go test ./...
make compat
```

Run the complete pinned OpenLDAP, race, fuzz, and Web administration gate:

```sh
make full
```

See [testing](docs/testing.md) before running `make full`; it builds a pinned
OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference and requires native build dependencies. Release and
upgrade checks are documented in [release](docs/release.md).
