# ldap-go

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

`ldap-go` is a Go implementation of an LDAPv3 directory server targeting
behavioral and LDIF data compatibility with OpenLDAP 2.6.x. It includes a
persistent directory server, OpenLDAP-style client and offline tools, an LDAP
load balancer, and a bilingual Web administration console.

The project is under active development and is not a complete OpenLDAP drop-in
replacement. Treat the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md) as the
authoritative support boundary.

Common school/company directory workflows have passed the
[practical acceptance checks](docs/common-production-scope.md#practical-acceptance-on-2026-09-20):
10,000-user import/query/paging/persistence, crash recovery, single-writer
replication recovery, backup/restore, Web administration, and a same-SDK
OpenLDAP differential. This is a bounded functional acceptance, not complete
OpenLDAP parity or a capacity guarantee for every deployment.

## Explicit non-goals

- **OpenLDAP MDB/LMDB:** reimplementing its storage engine, native database files,
  and index format is outside the project scope. ldap-go uses bbolt; migrate
  directory data through `slapcat` LDIF rather than copying MDB files.
- **Third-party modules:** further reimplementation of third-party modules and
  compatibility with their native module-loading ABIs are outside the project
  scope. Existing pure-Go implementations remain available within the
  [documented module coverage](docs/openldap-module-coverage.md).

These are deliberate scope exclusions, not pending features or gaps to count
against completion of the in-scope OpenLDAP functionality.

## Highlights

- LDAPv3 Bind, Search, Compare, Add, Modify, Delete, ModifyDN, StartTLS,
  Password Modify, common controls, aliases, referrals, and transactions.
- bbolt persistence with atomic LDIF import/export, backup, restore, rebuild,
  integrity checking, online backup, and retention tooling.
- OpenLDAP `cn=config`, schema, ACL, overlay, replication, Monitor, proxy, and
  offline-tool compatibility for the explicitly tested subset.
- Simple Bind, SASL PLAIN/CRAM-MD5/DIGEST-MD5/SCRAM/GSSAPI/EXTERNAL, TLS,
  LDAPS, LDAPI, and GB/T 38636 TLCP transports.
- OpenLDAP password schemes plus SM3, salted SM3, PBKDF2-SM3, and supported
  contributed password modules.
- ACL-preserving Web administration with English and Simplified Chinese UI.
- Differential tests against a pinned OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference build.

Detailed implementation claims and boundaries are recorded in the
[implementation status](docs/implementation-status.md), not duplicated here.

## Performance snapshot

Latest SDK comparison: September 23, 2026, 100,000 users, Apple M1 Pro,
Go built without cgo, OpenLDAP 2.6.13. Each row totals 20 operations; values are
medians from three fresh processes. Writes follow fixture setup and cache warmup.
Relative performance is `OpenLDAP / ldap-go * 100%`; above 100% favors ldap-go.

| Metric | ldap-go | OpenLDAP | Relative performance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Root Bind | 4.77 ms | 2.84 ms | 59.6% |
| Base search | 3.84 ms | 3.36 ms | 87.5% |
| Indexed equality | 3.41 ms | 2.95 ms | 86.4% |
| Compare, matching | 4.13 ms | 2.34 ms | 56.8% |
| Prefix substring | 1,240.35 ms | 644.73 ms | 52.0% |
| Add | 31.10 ms | 115.31 ms | 370.8% |
| Modify, unindexed description | 17.38 ms | 122.69 ms | 706.1% |
| ModifyDN | 35.51 ms | 121.37 ms | 341.8% |
| Delete | 28.04 ms | 135.41 ms | 482.9% |

All exported ordinary-attribute data matched. The larger write gaps are removed
for this warm leaf-write fixture; startup, cold initialization, Bind, substring
queries and memory still have gaps. Post-workload RSS was 389.7 / 135.4 MiB.
The [latest write report](docs/performance-optimization-20260923-round8.md)
includes baseline comparisons, startup costs, configuration limits and raw
evidence. Earlier [read/paging measurements](docs/openldap-100k-evidence.md)
and [DN/Bind measurements](docs/performance-optimization-20260923-round7.md)
use different workloads and are retained separately.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or newer.
- Production binaries build with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; a C compiler is not required.
- OpenLDAP client tools are optional for manual interoperability checks.
- Node.js and Chromium are needed only for Web administration browser tests.
- Building the pinned OpenLDAP differential environment requires the native
  dependencies documented in [testing](docs/testing.md).

## Quick start

Build the binary, import the example directory, and start an LDAP listener:

```sh
mkdir -p ./bin ./data
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./bin/ldap-go ./cmd/ldap-go

./bin/ldap-go import \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./examples/base.ldif \
  -replace

LDAP_GO_ROOT_PASSWORD='change-me' \
  ./bin/ldap-go serve \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -root-dn cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
```

Query it with an OpenLDAP client in another terminal:

```sh
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com -W \
  -b dc=example,dc=com '(objectClass=*)'
```

Start the Web administration console against the same LDAP listener:

```sh
./bin/ldap-go web-admin \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 \
  -ldap-url ldap://127.0.0.1:1389
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and sign in with an LDAP Bind DN. See
[operations](docs/operations.md) for LDAPI, OpenLDAP connections, TLS/TLCP,
backups, auditing, health checks, and production deployment.

## OpenLDAP migration

OpenLDAP backend files are implementation-specific and cannot be copied into
ldap-go. Export from a stopped or application-read-only source so separately
captured databases form a consistent migration set, then use `slapcat` LDIF as
the migration contract:

```sh
slapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif
slapcat -n 1 -l data-1.ldif

./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./config.ldif -replace
./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./data-1.ldif -database 1 -replace
```

The supported multi-database flow, offline aliases, validation behavior, and
password hash policy are documented in
[migration and passwords](docs/migration-and-passwords.md).

For a legacy `slapd.conf`, convert and validate the configuration in pure Go
before importing directory data:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./cmd/slapdconf-convert \
  -f /path/to/slapd.conf -out ./config.ldif
```

See [slapd.conf conversion](docs/slapdconf-conversion.md) for supported
directives, strict failure behavior, and direct database output.

## Development

Run the normal local checks:

```sh
go test ./...
make compat
```

Run the complete pinned OpenLDAP, race, fuzz, and Web administration gate:

```sh
make full
```

See [testing](docs/testing.md) before running `make full`; it builds a pinned
OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference and requires native build dependencies. Release and
upgrade checks are documented in [release](docs/release.md).
