# ldap-go

`ldap-go` is a Go implementation of an LDAPv3 directory server targeting
behavioral and data compatibility with OpenLDAP 2.6.x.

The project is under active development. Compatibility is tracked explicitly in
[docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md); an item is not supported until
its conformance and differential tests pass.

## Compatibility target

- LDAPv3 wire protocol and data model defined by the RFC 4510 family.
- OpenLDAP 2.6.x `slapd` behavior, controls, extended operations, schema,
  access control, overlays, replication, and operational attributes.
- Lossless import of canonical `slapcat` LDIF, including UUID/CSN metadata and
  `cn=config`.
- Interoperability with OpenLDAP command-line clients and common LDAP SDKs.
- TLS, StartTLS, SASL, and an extensible transport layer for national
  cryptography support.

Binary OpenLDAP database files are implementation-specific and are not the
portable migration contract. `slapcat` LDIF is the authoritative data exchange
format supplied by OpenLDAP itself.

## Development

```sh
go test ./...
```

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the implementation model
and [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) for compatibility gates.
