# ldap-go

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

`ldap-go` is a Go implementation of an LDAPv3 directory server targeting
behavioral and LDIF data compatibility with OpenLDAP 2.6.x. It includes a
persistent directory server, OpenLDAP-style client and offline tools, an LDAP
load balancer, and a bilingual Web administration console.

The project is under active development and is not a complete OpenLDAP drop-in
replacement. Treat the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md) as the
authoritative support boundary.

Common school/company directory workflows have passed the
[practical acceptance checks](docs/common-production-scope.md#practical-acceptance-on-2026-09-20):
10,000-user import/query/paging/persistence, crash recovery, single-writer
replication recovery, backup/restore, Web administration, and a same-SDK
OpenLDAP differential. This is a bounded functional acceptance, not complete
OpenLDAP parity or a capacity guarantee for every deployment.

## Explicit non-goals

- **OpenLDAP MDB/LMDB:** reimplementing its storage engine, native database files,
  and index format is outside the project scope. ldap-go uses bbolt; migrate
  directory data through `slapcat` LDIF rather than copying MDB files.
- **Third-party modules:** further reimplementation of third-party modules and
  compatibility with their native module-loading ABIs are outside the project
  scope. Existing pure-Go implementations remain available within the
  [documented module coverage](docs/openldap-module-coverage.md).

These are deliberate scope exclusions, not pending features or gaps to count
against completion of the in-scope OpenLDAP functionality.

## Highlights

- LDAPv3 Bind, Search, Compare, Add, Modify, Delete, ModifyDN, StartTLS,
  Password Modify, common controls, aliases, referrals, and transactions.
- bbolt persistence with atomic LDIF import/export, backup, restore, rebuild,
  integrity checking, online backup, and retention tooling.
- OpenLDAP `cn=config`, schema, ACL, overlay, replication, Monitor, proxy, and
  offline-tool compatibility for the explicitly tested subset.
- Simple Bind, SASL PLAIN/CRAM-MD5/DIGEST-MD5/SCRAM/GSSAPI/EXTERNAL, TLS,
  LDAPS, LDAPI, and GB/T 38636 TLCP transports.
- OpenLDAP password schemes plus SM3, salted SM3, PBKDF2-SM3, and supported
  contributed password modules.
- ACL-preserving Web administration with English and Simplified Chinese UI.
- Differential tests against a pinned OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference build.

Detailed implementation claims and boundaries are recorded in the
[implementation status](docs/implementation-status.md), not duplicated here.

## Performance snapshot

Latest comparison: September 30, 2026, R8b, 100,000 users, baseline `2645eba`,
Apple M1 Pro, Go 1.26.4 with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, OpenLDAP 2.6.13. Rows are
medians of three SDK batches with per-request endpoint rotation. Relative
performance is `OpenLDAP/current * 100%`; 100% means parity. Frequency is
qualitative, not measured traffic.

| Common operation | Typical use | Calls | ldap-go, default access | OpenLDAP, default access | Relative, default | Relative, explicit ACL |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| User Bind, SSHA | Very high | 1,000 | 91.42 ms | 73.11 ms | 80.0% | 81.3% |
| Non-root Base, hot | High | 1,000 | 114.02 ms | 92.36 ms | 81.0% | 77.9% |
| Non-root equality, hot | Very high | 1,000 | 119.22 ms | 93.10 ms | 78.1% | 77.4% |
| Direct group discovery | High | 100 | 14.87 ms | 11.90 ms | 80.0% | 75.7% |
| Group Base, 1,000 members | Medium | 100 | 97.25 ms | 89.19 ms | 91.7% | 93.1% |
| Nested membership, client BFS | Medium-high | 100 traversals | 49.14 ms | 40.02 ms | 81.4% | 77.6% |

Versus baseline `2645eba`, default SSHA Bind/direct group discovery improve
2.4%/2.9%, while hot equality/nested membership are 2.4%/1.9% slower. Broad
indexed/concurrent batches improve 10.0%/23.3%, but full-prefix scanning is
9.3% slower initially. Separate rotating rechecks improve paging/prefix by
3.9%/3.3%. Original write regressions and rechecks remain; recheck Add/ModifyDN
are still 1.7%/1.9% slower. **Per-operation parity is not achieved;
fast writes do not offset slow reads.** Shared-host results do not establish causality.

R8b removes value cloning in object-class checks and reuses existing prepared
attribute names without building a table on a miss. Compare component
allocations drop from 165 to 149 for one target, and 325 to 309 for rotating
targets; paired Compare SDK latency is essentially unchanged. Full tests,
schema oracles, vet and 355 native checks passed; all 47 final exports match.
The operational-attribute gap remains. Superseded R8 diagnostics stay separate.

See the [R8b report](docs/common-ldap-performance.md),
[evidence index](docs/evidence/performance-20260930-r8b/README.md) and
[verbatim R7 archive](docs/common-ldap-performance-20260930-r7.md).

The separate [R5 audit report](docs/audit-performance-20260929-r5.md) records a
conditional audit-observer component allocation reduction. It establishes no
ordinary-request speedup or production-latency gain and is separate from R8b.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or newer.
- Production binaries build with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; a C compiler is not required.
- OpenLDAP client tools are optional for manual interoperability checks.
- Node.js and Chromium are needed only for Web administration browser tests.
- Building the pinned OpenLDAP differential environment requires the native
  dependencies documented in [testing](docs/testing.md).

## Quick start

Build the binary, import the example directory, and start an LDAP listener:

```sh
mkdir -p ./bin ./data
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./bin/ldap-go ./cmd/ldap-go

./bin/ldap-go import \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./examples/base.ldif \
  -replace

LDAP_GO_ROOT_PASSWORD='change-me' \
  ./bin/ldap-go serve \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -root-dn cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
```

Query it with an OpenLDAP client in another terminal:

```sh
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com -W \
  -b dc=example,dc=com '(objectClass=*)'
```

Start the Web administration console against the same LDAP listener:

```sh
./bin/ldap-go web-admin \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 \
  -ldap-url ldap://127.0.0.1:1389
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and sign in with an LDAP Bind DN. See
[operations](docs/operations.md) for LDAPI, OpenLDAP connections, TLS/TLCP,
backups, auditing, health checks, and production deployment.

## OpenLDAP migration

OpenLDAP backend files are implementation-specific and cannot be copied into
ldap-go. Export from a stopped or application-read-only source so separately
captured databases form a consistent migration set, then use `slapcat` LDIF as
the migration contract:

```sh
slapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif
slapcat -n 1 -l data-1.ldif

./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./config.ldif -replace
./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./data-1.ldif -database 1 -replace
```

The supported multi-database flow, offline aliases, validation behavior, and
password hash policy are documented in
[migration and passwords](docs/migration-and-passwords.md).

For a legacy `slapd.conf`, convert and validate the configuration in pure Go
before importing directory data:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./cmd/slapdconf-convert \
  -f /path/to/slapd.conf -out ./config.ldif
```

See [slapd.conf conversion](docs/slapdconf-conversion.md) for supported
directives, strict failure behavior, and direct database output.

## Development

Run the normal local checks:

```sh
go test ./...
make compat
```

Run the complete pinned OpenLDAP, race, fuzz, and Web administration gate:

```sh
make full
```

See [testing](docs/testing.md) before running `make full`; it builds a pinned
OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference and requires native build dependencies. Release and
upgrade checks are documented in [release](docs/release.md).
