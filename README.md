# ldap-go

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

`ldap-go` is a Go implementation of an LDAPv3 directory server targeting
behavioral and LDIF data compatibility with OpenLDAP 2.6.x. It includes a
persistent directory server, OpenLDAP-style client and offline tools, an LDAP
load balancer, and a bilingual Web administration console.

The project is under active development and is not a complete OpenLDAP drop-in
replacement. Treat the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md) as the
authoritative support boundary.

Common school/company directory workflows have passed the
[practical acceptance checks](docs/common-production-scope.md#practical-acceptance-on-2026-09-20):
10,000-user import/query/paging/persistence, crash recovery, single-writer
replication recovery, backup/restore, Web administration, and a same-SDK
OpenLDAP differential. This is a bounded functional acceptance, not complete
OpenLDAP parity or a capacity guarantee for every deployment.

## Explicit non-goals

- **OpenLDAP MDB/LMDB:** reimplementing its storage engine, native database files,
  and index format is outside the project scope. ldap-go uses bbolt; migrate
  directory data through `slapcat` LDIF rather than copying MDB files.
- **Third-party modules:** further reimplementation of third-party modules and
  compatibility with their native module-loading ABIs are outside the project
  scope. Existing pure-Go implementations remain available within the
  [documented module coverage](docs/openldap-module-coverage.md).

These are deliberate scope exclusions, not pending features or gaps to count
against completion of the in-scope OpenLDAP functionality.

## Highlights

- LDAPv3 Bind, Search, Compare, Add, Modify, Delete, ModifyDN, StartTLS,
  Password Modify, common controls, aliases, referrals, and transactions.
- bbolt persistence with atomic LDIF import/export, backup, restore, rebuild,
  integrity checking, online backup, and retention tooling.
- OpenLDAP `cn=config`, schema, ACL, overlay, replication, Monitor, proxy, and
  offline-tool compatibility for the explicitly tested subset.
- Simple Bind, SASL PLAIN/CRAM-MD5/DIGEST-MD5/SCRAM/GSSAPI/EXTERNAL, TLS,
  LDAPS, LDAPI, and GB/T 38636 TLCP transports.
- OpenLDAP password schemes plus SM3, salted SM3, PBKDF2-SM3, and supported
  contributed password modules.
- ACL-preserving Web administration with English and Simplified Chinese UI.
- Differential tests against a pinned OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference build.

Detailed implementation claims and boundaries are recorded in the
[implementation status](docs/implementation-status.md), not duplicated here.

## Performance snapshot

Latest SDK comparison: September 23, 2026, 100,000 users, Apple M1 Pro,
Go built without cgo, OpenLDAP 2.6.13. Values are batch-time medians from three
fresh processes; operation counts are shown. Writes follow setup and cache warmup.
Relative performance is `OpenLDAP / ldap-go * 100%`; above 100% favors ldap-go.

| Metric | Operations | ldap-go | OpenLDAP | Relative performance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| User Bind, SSHA | 1,000 | 132.30 ms | 69.13 ms | 52.2% |
| Root Bind | 1,000 | 88.75 ms | 66.51 ms | 74.9% |
| Base search | 1,000 | 103.91 ms | 84.25 ms | 81.1% |
| Indexed equality | 1,000 | 110.24 ms | 91.05 ms | 82.6% |
| Compare, matching | 1,000 | 109.18 ms | 73.21 ms | 67.0% |
| Prefix substring | 20 | 1,123.83 ms | 620.02 ms | 55.2% |
| Add | 20 | 16.60 ms | 95.42 ms | 574.9% |
| Modify, unindexed description | 20 | 9.37 ms | 90.09 ms | 961.8% |
| ModifyDN | 20 | 27.93 ms | 102.22 ms | 366.0% |
| Delete | 20 | 18.09 ms | 92.74 ms | 512.7% |

Complete ordinary-attribute exports matched. The [latest report](docs/performance-optimization-20260923-round10.md)
records another 23% user-Bind and 17% Root-Bind time reduction against `fc58dd4`,
plus 38% lower retained heap in the diagnostic fixture. Read/auth RSS was
442.5 / 145.2 MiB. Other query timings were largely unchanged; the report retains
the mixed write results and their larger-batch recheck. Startup, cold
initialization, Bind, substrings and memory remain gaps.
The [write-index report](docs/performance-optimization-20260923-round8.md)
documents initialization costs; [historical paging results](docs/openldap-100k-evidence.md)
use a different workload.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or newer.
- Production binaries build with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; a C compiler is not required.
- OpenLDAP client tools are optional for manual interoperability checks.
- Node.js and Chromium are needed only for Web administration browser tests.
- Building the pinned OpenLDAP differential environment requires the native
  dependencies documented in [testing](docs/testing.md).

## Quick start

Build the binary, import the example directory, and start an LDAP listener:

```sh
mkdir -p ./bin ./data
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./bin/ldap-go ./cmd/ldap-go

./bin/ldap-go import \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./examples/base.ldif \
  -replace

LDAP_GO_ROOT_PASSWORD='change-me' \
  ./bin/ldap-go serve \
  -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -root-dn cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
```

Query it with an OpenLDAP client in another terminal:

```sh
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:1389 \
  -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com -W \
  -b dc=example,dc=com '(objectClass=*)'
```

Start the Web administration console against the same LDAP listener:

```sh
./bin/ldap-go web-admin \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 \
  -ldap-url ldap://127.0.0.1:1389
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and sign in with an LDAP Bind DN. See
[operations](docs/operations.md) for LDAPI, OpenLDAP connections, TLS/TLCP,
backups, auditing, health checks, and production deployment.

## OpenLDAP migration

OpenLDAP backend files are implementation-specific and cannot be copied into
ldap-go. Export from a stopped or application-read-only source so separately
captured databases form a consistent migration set, then use `slapcat` LDIF as
the migration contract:

```sh
slapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif
slapcat -n 1 -l data-1.ldif

./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./config.ldif -replace
./bin/ldap-go import -db ./data/ldap-go.db \
  -ldif ./data-1.ldif -database 1 -replace
```

The supported multi-database flow, offline aliases, validation behavior, and
password hash policy are documented in
[migration and passwords](docs/migration-and-passwords.md).

For a legacy `slapd.conf`, convert and validate the configuration in pure Go
before importing directory data:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./cmd/slapdconf-convert \
  -f /path/to/slapd.conf -out ./config.ldif
```

See [slapd.conf conversion](docs/slapdconf-conversion.md) for supported
directives, strict failure behavior, and direct database output.

## Development

Run the normal local checks:

```sh
go test ./...
make compat
```

Run the complete pinned OpenLDAP, race, fuzz, and Web administration gate:

```sh
make full
```

See [testing](docs/testing.md) before running `make full`; it builds a pinned
OpenLDAP 2.6.13 reference and requires native build dependencies. Release and
upgrade checks are documented in [release](docs/release.md).
